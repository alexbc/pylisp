Ulisp, a simple python lisp interpreter

Currently mostly working, with support for:
Closures/lambdas
normal s-expressions
macros
as well as
Strings/ints/booleans/functions/lists/etc.

Lacking a little in terms of primitives, however it is working and is kind of useful.

It could use a lot more testing though, and there are not guarantees that this will actually work in any way shape or form.
